        For many people, the unfortunate event is covered by an insurance
        policy, but others find themselves without anyone to turn to for medical
        advice, assistance or even medical evacuation. We are here to help no
        matter what the circumstances might be.

        Some people are not acutely unwell or injured but are still unable to
        fly easily on their own and a family member or friend is unable to
        accompany them. They may purely have need of assistance to enable them
        to meet their personal needs during the flight.

        You may have specific needs for a patient in our region. You may need
        the patient transferred to a designated meeting point or admitted safely
        into a well located hospital, while they await the next phase of the
        repatriation. The options are varied and we are flexible and responsive
        to your specific requests.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        We can carry out as much or as little of the entire case management as
        you require.

      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        We are approached by an increasing number of companies and hospitals who
        ‘self fund’ our type of medical services as they are needed.  Many
        hospitals and other Health organisations find themselves providing
        immediate care for patients, who live interstate or overseas and require
        assistance to return to a hospital nearer home for ongoing or long term
        care.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Some patients need help to travel to and from many locations, both
        nationally and internationally to access the specialised care they need
        in a particular centre.
      </p>
      <h4 data-aos="fade-up">Embassies & consulates</h4>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Many patients may tu rn to an Embassy or Consulate for help in
        an emergency, who in turn can contact us.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-up">
        Whether you are an individual needing help or a large organisation
        exploring all the available services, we are available to answer your
        inquiry at any time, 24 hours of every day.
