            Zoll AED Pro Device
        </h2>
        <p>
        Whether used in a hospital or in the field, the new ZOLL AED Pro® is designed to perform in any environment. It provides the ruggedness, portability, 
        and advanced functionality that professional rescuers and services require from an automated external defibrillator (AED).
        <br>
        The AED Pro has a robust design with rubber over-moulds, built to withstand harsh environments. It is extremely resistant to dust 
        and water jets and is the only AED in the industry to withstand a 1.5 metre drop test, making it a great choice for emergency medical transfers.
        </p>
        <p>
        It has automatic self testing to ensure a constant state of readiness. Designed with advanced capabilities, the ZOLL AED Pro supports 
        Basic Life Support as well as Advanced Life Support professionals. 
        This advanced AED features a high-resolution LCD display that allows responders to visualize a 
        patient’s ECG while utilizing a 3-lead monitoring cable. It can be used in a semi-automatic mode for 
        single operators with manual override for ALS professionals 
        and has Intelligent Paediatric capability with pedi-padz®II Paediatric Electrodes enabling it to function well 
        for paediatric patients as well as adults. <br>

        This machine ensures we can provide essential life support care while in transit 
        with any patient and it complements the equipment kits we use for patients we transfer by Commercial Airline.
